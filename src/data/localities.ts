        description: "Kharadi is Pune's fastest-evolving IT & commercial corridor, anchored by EON IT Park, World Trade Center, and Zensar/Barclays campuses. Its strategic position — just 12 km from Pune Airport and well-connected via the Kharadi-Wagholi bypass — makes it the preferred choice for professionals seeking city-center proximity. Property prices have risen 38% over 5 years, with 2026 seeing sustained demand from IT professionals and NRI investors. While Shapoorji Pallonji's primary Pune presence is in Hinjewadi and Hadapsar, Kharadi homebuyers benefit from nearby Joyville projects that offer superior construction quality at competitive pricing.",
